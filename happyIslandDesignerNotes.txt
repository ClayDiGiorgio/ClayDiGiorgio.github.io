when the json loads, there are two categories (not sure where paths go yet)
"objects" which lists the placeable objects
    each object type has its own array
    in this array are the x, y coordinates of the top left of the object
        for example, `construction_bridgeStoneHorizontal": [69,79]` describes a horizontal stone bridge with a top left corner at x=69, y=79, where (0,0) is the top left
    if there are multiple of the same object, then their coordinates will all be listed in the same array
        `"construction_bridgeStoneVertical": [0, 90, 6, 0]`
        this describes two vertical stone bridges, one with a top left corner at (0, 90) and one with a top left corner at (6, 0)
"drawing" which lists the terrain
    water 
        the default terrain tile
        when nothing is listed for a given tile, it's water
    
    each tile appears to have 8 entries
        when the only map tile was sand at square (0,0),
        the sand array looked like this: [1,0, 1,1, 0,1, 0,0]
        I'm guessing right now that every two entries in one of the "drawing" arrays (such as "sand") represents one of the crossing points of the gridlines. rather than the squares being painted, or the squares turned into triangles, the crossings are painted instead
        
        each terrain type (landlow, landmid, landhi, sand, rock) has its own array (this format allows neighboring tiles to exist)
    
    paths seem to be done the same way, with entries for them listed below. HOWEVER, these keys will not be listed in the json AT ALL if that given path type isn't present on the map
        pathBrick
        pathDirt
        pathSand
        pathStone
    
    json entries
        level1
        level2
        level3
        rock
        sand
